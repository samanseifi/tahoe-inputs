<B>Film Creasing and Wrinkling Simulation</B>
In this set of simulations we are trying to simulate the different types of surface instabilities on material surfaces. These are either in range of creasing or wrinkling instabilities. The following cartoon shows the electrical, mechanical and surface loadings on a thin film with HxL dimensions.

voltage0.xml: 80x4 or 160x4 film with zero surface tension

voltage1.xml: 80x4 or 160x4 film with surface tension of 1

voltage10.xml: 80x4 or 160x4 film with surface tension of 10

there is gonna be different test cases in future for gamma = 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 32 in order to plot the normalized surface tension vs. spacing (wave length) of the creasing or wrinkling waves.

test1.xml: in order to test the passivating the side sets in Tahoe. An 8x8 element.
